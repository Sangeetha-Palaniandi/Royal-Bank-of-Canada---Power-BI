# Royal-Bank-of-Canada---Power-BI

Aim:
To analyze the Royal Bank of Canada Customers Details.

Tools:
POWER BI.

Project Description:
 Banking is a critical sector of any economy, and the Royal Bank of Canada is one of the largest banks in Canada. To set the background of dashboard and chart design colours I used the RBC logo as reference. So that the dashboard colours looks in combination of blue, yellow and white. With the help of Power BI, I have created a dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the RBC bank's performance.This visual shows the data of the customers who are all active and inactive customers between 2016 to 2019, you can see year on year the no of customers are also been increased.  The next one shows the customers based on the credit type. As I categoried the customers as fair,poor,good and excellent based on the credit score.On the left-hand side of the dashboard, you will see that I have included a set of slicers. These slicers are designed to allow you to filter and sort the data by the number of customers. For example I want to see particular year, month and date wise we can check the data.
